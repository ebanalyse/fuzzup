`fuzzup` offers (1) a simple approach for clustering string entitities based on 
[Levenshtein Distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance) using
[Fuzzy Matching](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fuzzy_matching_(computer-assisted_translation))
in conjunction with a simple rule-based clustering method. 

`fuzzup` also provides (2) functions for computing the prominence of the resulting 
entity clusters resulting from (1).

`fuzzup` has been designed to fit the output from NER predictions from the [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/) [transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) [NER pipeline](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/v4.16.2/en/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.TokenClassificationPipeline) specifically.

## Installation guide
`fuzzup` can be installed from the Python Package Index (PyPI) by:

```
pip install fuzzup
```

If you want the development version then install directly from [Github](https://github.com/ebanalyse/fuzzup).

## Workflow

... COMING SOON!

## To do

- run against tores list
- document whitelist matching in showcase
- update readme with workflow
- tests for whitelist
- try and tune on junges entitites
- cutoff_threshold -> score_cutoff -> cdist
- ~~document whitelist~~~
- ~~update docs~~

## Background
`fuzzup` is developed as a part of [Ekstra Bladet](https://ekstrabladet.dk/)â€™s activities on Platform Intelligence in News (PIN). PIN is an industrial research project that is carried out in collaboration between the [Technical University of Denmark](https://www.dtu.dk/), [University of Copenhagen](https://www.ku.dk/) and [Copenhagen Business School](https://www.cbs.dk/) with funding from [Innovation Fund Denmark](https://innovationsfonden.dk/). The project runs from 2020-2023 and develops recommender systems and natural language processing systems geared for news publishing, some of which are open sourced like `fuzzup`.
